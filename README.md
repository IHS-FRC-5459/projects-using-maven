# projects-using-maven

This project was created to show how to use Maven as a build tool for robotics components.  Here's the link for maven
  * Apache-Maven project - http://maven.apache.org/

The project "Strongback" files were included here and built.

The structure here would accomodate multiple sub-projects under one hierarchy.  Including the projects is easy using
Maven's dependency structure.

You will need to download and install Maven to use this from the command line.  Mars Eclipse has a 
maven plugin for importing projects.
